# Exploring-AWS-Services
This project aims at documenting the capabilities of different AWS Services (Architecting in the Cloud)
Introduction



To explore AWS service, you will need an AWS Account. You can create an account by using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all">link</a>.

For this project, I will be using Amazon free tire account. Before you a free tier account, please note the following free tier account conditions:
1. Amazon Elastic Cloud computer EC2 Linux t2.micro 750Hours per month
2.  750 Hours t2.micro windows instance per month
3. 2000 Put requests of Amazon S3 (single PUT Request max 5GB)
4.  20000 Get requests of Amazon S3 (Each request Get request)
5. Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance with t2.micro 5GB storage
6. MSSQL Express version t2.micro with 20GB GP-SSD Free
Also, note that you will need the following in order to create a free tier Account:

Email address

Telephone number


Credit card

The credit card will not be charged for usage below AWS Free Tier limits. AWS will temporarily hold $1 USD/EUR as a pending transaction for 3-5 days for identity verification.
